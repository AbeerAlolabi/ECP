        <p>The Education, Conflict and Peacebuilding (ECP) Interest Group includes graduate students, faculty, and practitioners, who are all exploring the intersection between education, peace, conflict, and development. ECP conducts monthly meetings that involve a deep and critical exploration into a current issue or topic within the field. Any participant can volunteer to facilitate and lead a monthly session or share their own research and practitioner experience with the group. We welcome anyone with an interest in this topic to join a monthly meeting or our mailing list by contacting us at ecp.oise@gmail.com

      Emergent Questions:
    </h2>
    <p>
      

- Does the mobilizing of ‘emergencies’ gives rise to corporate and philanthropic interventions going unquestioned? What are the drivers for foreign intervention?
</p>
<p>- EiE as a current version of EFA? Does EiE miss how education is contributing to the problem and reproduction of inequities? What are the possibilities of non-formal education in emergencies?
</p>
<p>-Terms that are central to EiE discourses - like protection, coping and resilience. Why might these ground EiE and not other possible terms/concepts? Who is constructing the field of EiE?
